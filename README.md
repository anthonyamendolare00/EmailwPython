# EmailwPython
Python's smtp library helps send emails through easy automation. The email can attach a subject, to, from, image, links, and texts. It is ideal to use a Gmail account and the sender's email must have a password that is known to allow access to send the email. Port 587 is a default mail submission port. The goal of this project was to find new libraries that I have not used before when coding in Python including ssl and smtplib.
